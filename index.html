	<h2>Capital Allocation and Corporate Strategy: An Examination of the Oil & Gas Majors:</h2>
		<p>Capital allocation may be the most critical means that corporate leaders have of trans- lating corporate strategy into action.1 It impacts the returns the corporation generates
for its investors, the growth rates it delivers over the long term, and its ability to sustain its com- petitive advantage. Successful capital allocation means converting inputs‚Äîmoney, resources, ideas, and people‚Äîinto something more valuable than they would be otherwise.2 Underscoring the centrality of capital allocation, Warren Buffett describes it as, ‚Äúif not the key function of the CEO, one of two or three key functions at say 80 or 90 percent of all companies.‚Äù

Capital allocation must also achieve a difficult objective: find- ing the proper balance between reinvesting in the business and returning capital to investors. This study examines the capi- tal allocation approaches adopted by the five major publicly traded integrated oil and gas (O&G) companies over the past two decades. These global oil ‚Äúmajors‚Äù provide a rich context for exploring capital allocation in one of the most important and capital-intensive global industries.
We find that the five companies differed markedly in how they decided between returning funds to shareholders and reinvesting in the business over time. We also find that that while capital allocation decisions vary depending on the strategic emphasis pursued by the firms, capital deployment decisions are also dependent on the external environment in the capital and product markets tied to the oil and gas industry. We link the capital allocation approaches to strategic choices and raise questions about the efficacy of the different approaches evidenced.
The oil and gas industry is an excellent subject because it is particularly capital intensive. During the two decades spanning 1998 to 2018, the five largest global supermajors collectively spent $1.8 trillion on capital expenditures. And while these O&G majors seem similar in terms of business lines and inter- national operations, there is considerable variation in their capital allocation practices. What‚Äôs more, the O&G industry‚Äôs capital allocation task is particularly challenging today because oil and natural gas are non-renewable resources with highly uncertain productive lives, and alternative fuel sources represent significant threats to the industry‚Äôs future. Both these industry attributes accentuate the importance of the capital allocation decision.
The industry incumbents are forced to address the same questions year after year: how much of our current operating cash flow should we reinvest in the business, and how much capital should be returned to our shareholders? If capital is invested in the business should it be in the upstream, midstream, downstream,4 or petrochemicals business? If a large amount of capital is returned to the shareholders, is this a signal that the firm sees limited opportunities for future growth? Or is it instead a sign of our commitment to make the most efficient use of investor capital?

Capital Allocation Paths in Oil and Gas Companies All oil and gas firms must decide how much capital to rein- vest in the business; and having done so, how much to return to investors. If capital is to be returned, should it be paid divi- dends or share repurchases? But if reinvested, which of the many possible forms should it take: traditional capital expenditures, research and development (R&D), new value-creating activi- ties, or debt reduction designed to provide financial flexibility?5
The most basic capital allocation decision focuses on management‚Äôs decision whether it has, or expects to have, better uses for its capital than those of its investors. What‚Äôs more, when making decisions to pay out capital, companies also recognize their substantial ability to raise capital from the outside while returning portions of it to shareholders. U.S. capital markets allow profitable, as well as many promising but as yet unprof- itable, companies to raise debt or equity capital quickly, and to change capital allocation as circumstances change and as opportunities present themselves.
Nevertheless, senior corporate managers often see themselves as financially constrained in many important respects. Like many other Fortune 500 firms, the O&G majors are extremely reluctant to cut dividends even if underlying business conditions have deteriorated, believing that their credi- bility with investors is at stake. Some officially label dividends as ‚Äúnon-discretionary‚Äù capital allocations, clearly suggesting that these allocations are almost mandatory.
That said, some of the majors have been forced to cut dividends on occasion. For example, BP reduced its dividend in 2010 after the Macondo disaster that caused a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This cut was made despite BP‚Äôs Investor Proposition ‚Äúto grow sustainable free cash flow and distribu- tions to shareholders over the long term.‚Äù6 Similarly, between 2015 and 2017, Shell gave shareholders the option to take their dividends in shares instead of cash in order to preserve cash.
Alternatively, companies may return cash to shareholders through share repurchases instead of dividends. Neither investors nor managers think of share repurchases as continuing and fixed obligations of the firm, which allows managers more discretion. That said, share repurchases have been done so often in some firms they may be beginning to seem like an established practice.
Capital Expenditures
Capital allocation is a multifunctional task that must be inte- grated with the firm‚Äôs competitive and corporate strategies.7 Given the wide range of investment pathways open to senior management as shown in Figure 1, capital allocation is the lever both for making strategic choices and signaling strategic intent to both internal and external stakeholders.
The link between capital allocation and strategy is especially important for companies in commodity product industries such as oil and gas. As Gregory Milano, head of Fortuna Advisors observes, ‚Äústrategy is inextricably tied to capital deployment in the sense that if you‚Äôre a commodity business with no really compelling comparative advantages, all that matters is how you deploy capital; that‚Äôs really the only way you can add value.‚Äù8
To maintain and grow the productive capability of any oil and gas firm requires either continuous capital expenditure or acquisitions that provide economies of scale or scope so essen- tial to commodity businesses. Upstream capex is necessary to replace reserves and to bring new fields into production. Midstream capex is required to move crude oil, condensates, and natural gas to the downstream for refining and sales to consumers. Downstream capex is needed to maintain, upgrade, and expand the refineries, chemical plants, and other assets used to create products consumers want. And as Figure 1 shows, this investment can be for either existing or new activities. ExxonMobil‚Äôs Approach to Capital Expenditures
In an interview that took place in 2005, ExxonMobil‚Äôs then CEO (and de facto CFO) Lee Raymond explained the compa- ny‚Äôs capital investment policy as follows:9
Any single quarter, any single year can‚Äôt be viewed in isolation from any other quarter or any other year. Over the past 10 years we have actually invested more money than we made....People need to understand we are in a commodity business. The price of commodi- ties goes up and down. There are peaks and valleys. Our view on the investment side is we want to clip off the peaks and valleys and take a long-term view which goes through the midpoint of all that. We‚Äôve had that philosophy for the last 15 or 20 years. If you look at any single point in time you can come to the wrong answer either way. Someone could argue that in 1998 we invested way too much money. And now we are in a peak and people are saying why don‚Äôt you spend more money. My comment is the valley will be coming. And when the valley comes, we are going to continue to invest... We try and maintain a steady but ever-growing investment program. We know we have cyclicality in our earnings. So now the question we face is how do we manage the financial structure of the corporation? How do we make sure we can get the most value for the shareholder, recognizing that the stream of earnings will never be consistent with the investment needs? 

Figure 2 shows how the capital expenditures of all five majors rose and fell with the price of the benchmark Brent crude oil in the 20 years from 1998 to 2018.10 In the first decade from 1998 to 2008, the majors seemed to increase capital expenditures as Lee Raymond suggested they should: ‚Äúin a steady but ever growing investment program.‚Äù This changed a bit in 2008-2009 when Shell and Chevron‚Äôs spend- ing flattened but then resumed an upward trend. BP reduced its capex in the 2008-2010 period and then began increasing its spending in 2011 even after the 2010 Macondo disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.
Although capital expenditures are usually budgeted annually, they do reflect majors‚Äô projections of long-term performance and desired results. In 2008, for example, Chevron announced that it would increase its capital expen- ditures by 15% over the previous year. But it is important to keep in mind that capex has two primary components, ‚Äúmaintenance capex‚Äù and ‚Äúgrowth capex.‚Äù For example, Shell reported that ‚Äúduring the period 2005-2007, around 65% of our capital expenditure was allocated to asset integrity and care and maintenance projects.‚Äù
Regardless of whether capex is maintenance or growth in nature, O&G projects often require many years to complete and sometimes even a decade, as in the cases of Kashagan in Kazakhstan and Gorgon in Australia. And this means that O&G capex is not simply a faucet one can turn on and off as market conditions change. Long-cycle oil develop- ment projects are multi-year commitments that are only very occasionally abandoned before completion.
Changes in Time and Circumstances
‚ÄúValue-maximizing capital deployment decisions depend on not only the internal operations of the company, but also the external environment in the capital and product markets.‚Äù11
When the world financial crisis began in the fall of 2008, oil prices dropped sharply as economic output contracted. The benchmark WTI oil price fell from $147 per barrel in July 2008 to $33 by February 2009. Over the same time period, natural gas prices fell from $14 per MMBtu to just $4. U.S. oil consumption dropped by 5.4% (or 1.1 million barrels per day) during 2008, the biggest decline since 1980. Consumption dropped overseas as well during 2008, the first decline in world oil demand since the 1973-1974 oil crisis. In 2009, the next year, global oil consumption fell by another 1.2 million barrels per day, the largest volume decline since 1982.12
Because the crisis also affected global credit markets, many smaller oil and gas firms found it difficult to fund their exploration and production projects. This, in turn, led to a drop in the cost of materials, labor, and services used as inputs for upstream and downstream projects. In the face of such changes, it might have seemed reasonable to have expected oil and gas firms to scale back their capital expenditures during those two years. But the majors did not do so. In fact, they continued to increase capital expendi- tures very significantly. Capital expenditures by the majors increased by 38% in 2008 and were held at the same levels for 2009. In something of a delayed response, group capex flattened out in 2010.
Why did they do it? One possibility is that the majors were unable to escape the commitments they made in connection with new projects when oil prices were sky-high in 2007. But it is also likely the case that most of the majors were also fairly confident that their industry was just going through another cyclical decline and that demand would rebound in another year or two. Arguably, they could have seen the decline as an opportunity to invest when rates for drilling rigs and oilfield services were very depressed.
With history as their guide, the majors continued to believe that the oil and gas industry necessarily involved long-term capital commitments but was still subject to unpredictable oil price swings. Accordingly, the majors attempted to discern some long-term average hydrocar- bon price and publicly committed themselves to steering steadily towards that point on the horizon while ignoring the noisy, erratic fluctuations of oil and gas prices in the meantime. By staying the course, expanding production, and replacing reserves, they believed they would assure their future viability.
2014 and After
It became very difficult for the majors to maintain this posture, as prices started to fall again in 2012 and 2013 and even more precipitously in 2014. There was no solid indus- try consensus about why this was happening, but everyone noted that the fracking boom in the U.S. had resulted in much higher domestic oil and gas production and that output from restored capacity in Libya, South Sudan, and Iraq was quite significant. Oil prices also weakened because cheap natural gas was replacing oil as the feedstock of choice for petrochemicals producers and because previously bullish hedge fund managers unwound their long crude oil positions. 13
Profit margins on oil and gas production collapsed. For the first time, there was a palpable fear among the O&G companies that oil prices would stay low for a long while, perhaps becoming a ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù Rather than hold to their previously established capex plans as they had done in 2009, the majors slashed those budgets. In 2014, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell all cut capital expenditures. Chevron announced a 5% cut in 2014, and a further 24% cut in 2015.14 The majors as a group reduced capex from $149 billion in 2014 to $91 billion in 2016, and then to $80 billion in 2017 (see Figure 2). This was a cumulative drop in capital expenditure of more than 50% in just three years.
This was a secular, not a cyclical change, in indus- try practice. After 2014, internal operations and external environments began to shape capital allocation decisions. The industry was no longer committed to steadily increasing capex. Once familiar long-gestation megaprojects requir- ing massive capital expenditures sustained over a long-term horizon began to look dubious. The majors were forced to recognize that the output from unconventional shale oil and gas fields in the U.S. was making global offshore megapro- ject investments unattractive. They also noted that now mature technology such as horizontal drilling and fracking allowed smaller increments of capacity to be developed in short-cycle bursts of capital funding and that previously insignificant renewable sources of power such as solar and wind were becoming competitive with hydrocarbon fuels.
In 2015, Chevron began using the term short-cycle projects for the first time in its annual capex press release. The term, similar to sustaining capital projects, can be contrasted with high reward, long cycle megaprojects, which were the focus of the majors from 2000 to 2010. Short- cycle projects are smaller and usually viewed as less complex, easier to execute, and faster to bring online.
So, when oil prices began to rebound in 2016, indus- try capex lagged behind. Chevron‚Äôs CEO, John Watson, explained the new longer-run policy and perspective in 2017 when the firm‚Äôs lower 2018 capital expenditure budget was announced:
Our 2018 budget is down for the fourth consecutive year, reflecting project completions, improved efficiencies, and investment high-grading. We‚Äôre fully funding our advantaged Permian Basin position [unconventional oil] and dedicating approximately three-quarters of our spend to projects that are expected to realize cash flow within two years.15
This new view at Chevron was entirely consistent with that of the previously cited Greg Milano, who said that the effectiveness of ‚Äúvalue-maximizing capital deployment decisions depend on not only the internal operations of the company, but also the external environment in the capital and product markets.‚Äù16 In other words, when the environ- ment changes, capital allocation decisions will also change.
Production and Reserves
My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.
‚Äì Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland
Collectively, the five majors‚Äô production over the past two decades has been largely flat or marginally negative (Figure 3).17 The largest producer, ExxonMobil, peaked in 2011 at 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has declined subsequently. Production by the majors as a group grew 15.8% from 14.6 million boe/day in 1998 to 16.9 million in 2018. But most of the increased production over the 1998- 2018 period came from acquisitions. If Total‚Äôs acquisition of Petrofina and Elf Aquitaine in 1999-2000 is excluded, group production rose only 4.7% from 2000 to 2018, from 16.15 mmboe/day to 16.9 mmboe/day. For the five majors, that is very little collective production growth over a period of generally rising oil prices.
Similarly, none of the five majors has increased their proved reserves over the past decade (see Figure 4). Exxon- Mobil, again the largest, is the only one of the five to show an appreciable decline in proved reserves; all the others are essentially unchanged.

To summarize our findings about the five majors over the 20-year period:
1. The industry witnessed a stable period of growth from 1998-2008 characterized by stable and constantly growing capital expenditures;
2. The global crisis of 2008 followed by a drop in oil prices did not have significant negative impact on capital expendi- tures; most firms stayed the course;
3. The equilibrium shifted dramatically in 2014 with a steep price decline interpreted by the companies as a trans- formative shift calling for a serious re-consideration of capital expenditures; and
4. The companies have been unable to significantly grow either reserves or production over the time period despite the considerable sums allocated to exploration and production activity.
Free Cash Flow
A firm‚Äôs free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flow minus capex, and related measures are very significant. Free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF/Invested Capital, is a measure of a firm‚Äôs previous capital investments but also an indication of rising agency costs of free cash flow (see section below and Figure 10). A firm generating significant free cash flows, like ExxonMobil did for so many of the years in the study period,
had a multitude of choices ‚Äì increase the dividend, repur- chase more shares, acquire other companies, pay down debt, or simply accumulate cash.
Figure 5 shows the free cash flow return on invested capital for all five majors for 1998-2018. For most of the period, ExxonMobil outperformed its competitors, more than doubling their average returns. That performance differ- ence ended, however, with the fall of oil prices beginning in mid-2014. Despite ExxonMobil‚Äôs fall, it still led the majors through 2017.
Share Prices: How markets have viewed O&G firms‚Äô performance
As shown in Figure 5, the share prices of the five majors, unsurprisingly, have ebbed and flowed with the price of oil. The share prices of the five majors have been indexed to January 1, 1998, for comparison purposes. The prices of all five increased over the 2002-2008 period as oil prices rose to record highs. But the years following the financial crisis of 2008 were something of a roller coaster ride. By the end of 2018 only Chevron‚Äôs share price was above its January 2, 2008 price. The share prices of the other four declined over the decade.

The market‚Äôs opinion on four of the five majors is clearly not encouraging. Although there are a number of possible explanations for the poor share price performance for the majors other than Chevron, we believe the lack of growth in production and possibly reserves is a significant part of the story. One recent study concluded that changes in oil and natural gas liquids reserves was particularly important, and that investors did not differentiate between organic reserve replacement (exploration) and inorganic (acquisition).19
Figure 6 shows average total shareholder return and its two components, dividend yields and capital gains, for the five majors over the past 11 years. Shell, Total, and BP all averaged dividend yields above 5%. Both Chevron and ExxonMobil produced dividend yields of less than 4%. Chevron was the only company to produce a positive capital gains over the decade, an average of 2.7% annually. As a result Chevron had the highest TSR for the decade, averaging 6.3% per annum. Shell, although not produc- ing an average annual positive capital gain for the decade, ranked second in TSR because of its consistently higher dividend yields. Reinvesting Capital in the Business or
Giving It Back to the Shareholder?
It concerns us that, in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies have shied away from investing in the future growth oftheircompanies.Toomanycompanieshavecutcapitalexpendi- ture and even increased debt to boost dividends and increase share buybacks. We certainly believe that returning cash to sharehold- ers should be part of a balanced capital strategy; however, when done for the wrong reasons and at the expense of capital invest- ment, it can jeopardize a company‚Äôs ability to generate sustainable long-term returns.

Table 1 shows dividend distributions by the five majors over the past decade. Company behaviors are distinctly differ- ent. ExxonMobil and Chevron are both dividend aristocrats, defined as firms that have 25 or more years of consecutive divi- dend increases. In early 2018, ExxonMobil stated that one of its priorities was ‚Äúgrowing shareholder value and distributing that success to our shareholders through our dividend.‚Äù Shell reduced its dividends after 2009 and 2010. BP, since suffer- ing large losses associated with the Macondo spill in 2010, has struggled to return dividends to previous levels. Total has chosen to reduce dividends significantly in recent years with earnings and cash flows fell with the price of oil (see Figure 7).
Figure 8 shows the pattern of share repurchases by the majors over the past 20 years. ExxonMobil is the standout. Although trending downward over the last decade, its share repurchasing exceeded that of the other four majors put together. Cumulatively, ExxonMobil spent more than $249.5 billion repurchasing shares compared with $176.1 billion for the other four collectively. It reduced its shares outstanding by 39%. BP and Shell were distant followers, spending $58.6 billion and $42.4 billion, respectively. In fact, ExxonMobil‚Äôs repurchases over the period 2007-2016 were higher than that of any other U.S. firm.
The majors remain committed to maintaining their dividends but this has not resulted in share price appreciation. This makes share repurchases very important to shareholder wealth. Unfortunately, companies tend to repurchase when they have excess cash but this is usually when both oil prices and share prices are high (as Figure 5 shows).21
Figure 9 shows returns to shareholders relative to capital expenditures. Values above 1.0 indicate the firm is returning more capital to shareholders than is reinvested in the business through capex. ExxonMobil returned much more to share- holders than the other majors. BP was the only other major to have one or more years with capital returns to shareholders greater than capex.
Figure 9 provides the percentage of operating cash flow returned to shareholders for the five majors. Once again, ExxonMobil differs markedly from the others, returning the greatest percentage of operating cash flow to investors in every year but one. In many years, its relative proportion was double that of the four majors. Between 2008 and 2018, ExxonMobil averaged 58% of its operating cash flow returned to share- holders, while the other four majors all fell between 26% and 34%. From 2008 to 2012/13, the other four majors were very similar, returning between 20% and 40% of their operating cash flow to shareholders. But their paths diverged in 2014. Withsomerecoveryofoilpricesin2015and2016,BP,Shell, and Chevron increased their capital allocation to shareholders but reduced that in 2017 and 2018.
Companies can change the ratio of cash returned to share- holders to capex for several reasons. A shortage of attractive projects should lead firms to defer capital spending and return cash to their shareholders.22
Although the capital allocation policies of major oil companies are now much more attuned to changes in their business environments, they still favor paying conservative but dependable dividends. The percentage of operating cash flow returned as dividends is remarkably similar across four of the majors, the exception being Total, paying out a significantly lower percentage.
Chevron and ExxonMobil: A Tale of Two Majors
Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.
‚Äì Warren Buffett
We ask two important questions about ExxonMobil and Chevron:
1. Can too much cash be returned to investors, thereby reducing shareholder wealth?
2. Can capital be deployed in the businesses in ways that favors growth opportunities more effectively?
We begin by comparing the profitability‚Äîin terms of the profit per barrel of oil equivalent (boe)‚Äîof Chevron and ExxonMobil over the period 1998-2018. As Figure 11 shows, profitability for both companies rises and falls with the price of oil but ExxonMobil‚Äôs profit per boe was higher during most of the period. And although ExxonMobil has also been more successful in adding to its proved reserves23 than Chevron (Figure 4), Chevron has demonstrated superior share price performance (Figure 5). We believe the different approach to capital allocation is a key explanatory factor.
Free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capex) is one indicator of a firm‚Äôs ability to execute its corporate strategy successfully. Figure 11 shows these figures for Chevron and ExxonMobil. (Free cash flow is shown as a percentage of revenue to adjust for the size of the two companies.) Until 2017, ExxonMobil was generating significantly more free cash flow than Chevron, suggesting that ExxonMobil was in a stronger position to invest in new, attractive opportunities.
Professors Michael Jensen and William Meckling intro- duced the concept of the agency cost of free cash flow in their seminal 1976 paper.24 They emphasized that firms with high levels of free cash flow (defined as higher than needed to sustain the firm‚Äôs current operations) are at high risk of squan- dering it on negative net present value investments. Senior managers face tremendous temptation to use free cash flow to ‚Äúbuild empires‚Äù either through traditional capital expen- ditures or acquisitions, irrespective of rates of return, when their firms enjoy windfall free cash flows. Jensen pointed to the oil and gas industry as the most notable example of such an industry, noting:
Free cash flow theory predicts which mergers and takeovers are more likely to destroy, rather than to create, value; it shows how takeovers are both evidence of the conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers, and a solution to the problem. Acquisitions are one way managers spend cash instead of paying it out to shareholders. Therefore, the theory implies managers of firms with unused borrowing power and large free cash flows are more likely to undertake low-benefit or even value-destroying mergers.
The free cash problem of O&G companies is at least partially related to the commodity price cycle. Compa- nies enjoy high free cash flows after major oil and gas price increases but are then tempted to invest that right at the top of the price cycle. ExxonMobil‚Äôs $41 billion purchase of domestic gas producer XTO25 during the 2009-2010 period may qualify as one such unfortunate acquisition. Because oil and gas prices rose substantially in the years up until 2008, ExxonMobil enjoyed tremendous free cash flow and had the resources to make a large acquisition though it could also have distributed the cash through special dividends or higher share repurchases. Unfortunately for ExxonMobil sharehold- ers, gas prices fell sharply after the XTO purchase. In 2019 Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO when XTO was acquired, said ‚Äúwe probably paid too much.‚Äù We cannot be sure how much XTO‚Äôs acquisition reduced ExxonMobil‚Äôs TSR but it is likely significant. In retrospect, Chevron‚Äôs 2005 acquisition of Unocal was much better timed.26
Over the past two decades, Chevron didn‚Äôt devote nearly as much cash to dividends and share repurchases as Exxon- Mobil (Figure 8) but had better share price performance. This raises the question: Would ExxonMobil have created more shareholder wealth by reinvesting more in its business27 rather than returning so much cash to its shareholders?
Although this question cannot be answered definitively, we can speculate based on the different outcomes of the two companies. The most likely reason Chevron‚Äôs shares outper- formed ExxonMobil‚Äôs is that Chevron‚Äôs upstream production has been increasing in recent years whereas ExxonMobil‚Äôs production has been declining (Figure 3). Like ExxonMobil, Chevron‚Äôs increased production is primarily organic.
A Roundtable discussion published in this journal in 201428 raised the possibility that companies could be sacrific- ing value-adding growth opportunities by limiting investment while pushing for ever-higher returns. Gregory Milano pointed out, ‚ÄúThe goal of financial management, after all, is not to maximize returns on capital but net present value. And as many of us were taught in business school, maximizing NPV means taking not just the highest-return projects, but all projects that are expected to earn at least the cost of capital.‚Äù29
It is possible that during the period of high oil prices before 2014, when ExxonMobil was repurchasing shares most aggressively, the company was rejecting projects that could have earned at least the cost of capital. Chevron, in contrast, spent much more in capex in relation to its size (Figure 12) than the other majors in the 2010 to 2016 period.
As shown in Figure 13, once Chevron completed several megaprojects in 2016, it reduced capital expenditures in 2017, focusing capital on lower risk development areas like the United States.
No company demonstrates the complexity of capital allocation more than ExxonMobil. As noted in Table 1, Exxon- Mobil‚Äôs total shareholder return over the 20-year period was the lowest of the five majors. Recently, several activist investors have called for the company to increase its cash distributions to shareholders via reduced capex, despite the fact that Exxon- Mobil consistently returned more cash to shareholders than its super-major competitors over 20 years. ExxonMobil also had the highest distributions to shareholders/reinvestment in the business ratio over the period (Figure 8) and percentage of operating cash flow returned to shareholders (Figure 9), while staying committed to long-term development projects. It maintained this commitment through higher debt levels and this may limit the firm‚Äôs strategic flexibility in coming years. Share price returns in the upstream oil and gas industry are correlated with increasing production and proved reserves and both of those require sustained capital commitment. As we noted in the final section, the timing of capex combined with its specific commitments ultimately drive operating results. Dividends to shareholders in the absence of strong operating results are unlikely to result in higher share prices.
Finally, we should mention that both Chevron and ExxonMobil are involved in mega-projects in Kazakhstan. Chevron is the operator and 50% shareholder in the Tengiz project, one of the most lucrative projects in the history of the industry while ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder. Exxon- Mobil is a 16.81% shareholder in the Kashagan project in Kazakhstan‚Äôs sector of the Caspian Sea. Discovered in 2000, it was the world‚Äôs largest oil find in 30 years. Unfortunately, however, the original projected capex was $10 billion but this has since ballooned to more than $50 billion as the company struggled with many operational, governance, technical, and political issues.30 The project, in which Chevron has no stake, is known pejoratively as ‚Äúcash all gone.‚Äù
Looking Forward
Is the oil and gas industry a declining industry and if so, what does that mean for capital allocation? The world may be approaching Peak Oil Demand but people will continue to consume significant volumes of oil and gas for a long time. According to the IEA, global oil and gas demand will steadily increase over the next decade despite government policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adoption of electric vehicles. That said, long-standing industry metrics such as reserve growth and production growth will need to be reevaluated. Declining industries can still be rewarding for their investors as long as corporate management is realistic about demand for its products and invests its free cash flow accordingly.31
Conclusion
Capital allocation decisions are critical to the execution of a company‚Äôs strategy and may well be the most important determinants of long-term sustainable value. Moreover, since strategy and competitive positioning change over time, capital allocation must be dynamic. When the competitive environ- ment shifted, the majors adjusted their capital allocation, both in the split between business and investor and nature of capi- tal projects.
We draw a number of conclusions about the oil and gas industry and capital allocation. First, investment in the business via capex, although massive in terms of size and sustained effort, has failed to grow upstream oil and gas production for the five majors. Material growth in upstream production appears to have come mainly through acquisi- tions rather than ‚Äúorganic‚Äù capex that just seems to allow the firms to maintain stable production from year to year. Second, in commodity industries, where firms have limited pricing power, value creation will come from being a low cost competitor or growing volumes. In the world of oil and gas majors, low cost is tied to scale and technology. Capital allocation by the majors has periodically wandered from these principles.
Third, the success of capital expenditure programs arises from various factors‚Äîsize, placement, timing, type, cycle time and‚Äînot least‚Äîluck, given the industry‚Äôs geologic, political, and commodity risks.
Fourth, although all publicly traded companies claim to be in pursuit of profitable growth, the majors have not deliv- ered. The inherent challenges of a depleting industry partly explain the difficulty, but we believe capital allocation choices are also part of the explanation. Had ExxonMobil avoided just the XTO acquisition, it might have been able to increase shareholder value by investing more in their business while reducing distributions to shareholders.32
Finally, the metrics used to evaluate the majors‚Äô perfor- mance have evolved. Although shareholder wealth price is the ultimate measure of the success (or failure) of the firm‚Äôs strategy and capital allocation, there are other ways to evaluate a firm‚Äôs capital deployment such as reserve replacement. Additional reserves were seen as necessary for long-term sustainability. While still important, upstream production growth seems to have replaced reserves growth as the metric most closely watched by investors.
To conclude, other industries with substantial capex requirements could find themselves in a position similar to that of the oil and gas industry: long-standing industry accepted practices become threatened by competitive shifts that require rethinking capital allocation and strategy. The oil and gas industry adjusted its capital allocation practices as benchmark prices fell and long cycle mega-projects fell out of favor. The industry will always have to deal with making
strategic and financial decisions in an environment of high uncertainty.
